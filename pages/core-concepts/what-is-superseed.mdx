# What is Superseed?

Superseed is a network built on Ethereum that helps you take out loans and repay them automatically without you having to worry about it. It uses special technology to make sure the loans are paid off using money generated by the system itself.

Superseed uses something called an Optimistic Rollup, which is a fancy term for a system that allows Ethereum to process more transactions, making everything faster and cheaper. This helps keep fees low, and Superseed uses the profits from these transactions to repay loans.

**How does Superseed work?**:
  Here’s a basic flow of how Superseed works:

  - **You Take a Loan**: When you borrow money from Superseed, they give you access to the funds (called a loan). Unlike regular loans, you don’t have to pay any interest on the loan. This means no extra charges beyond what you borrow.
  - **Automatic Loan Repayment**: Normally, you’d have to repay loans by making regular payments. With Superseed, the system itself generates money through various activities and uses that money to pay off your loan automatically. This means your   loan is paid back without you actively doing anything.

Key components include:
- **Ethereum Layer 2 Technology**: Superseed is a system built on top of Ethereum, which makes transactions faster and cheaper. It’s easy to use because it works just like Ethereum, so developers can use tools they’re already familiar with. Plus, it’s open to everyone and free for anyone to build on.
- **Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)**: Superseed has a special system where you can borrow money by locking up some of your assets as collateral. This is built directly into the way Superseed works.
- **Proof-of-Repayment**: Superseed has a cool feature where part of its token supply is given out every day through an auction. The money from the auction is used to help pay off loans for users who have borrowed from the system.
- **Dynamic Repayment Vault**: This is like a smart vault that collects fees from the Superseed platform and automatically uses them to reduce users’ debt, making it easier for borrowers to repay their loans.
- **Supercollateral**: This is the main token of the Superseed platform. If you borrow money and have enough collateral (like 500% of the loan amount), you won’t be charged interest. Plus, all the fees collected by the platform are used to reduce the debt for people using this token.
- **The Superseed Stablecoin**: When you borrow money on Superseed, you receive a stablecoin (a type of cryptocurrency that aims to keep its value steady). To make sure this stablecoin stays stable, the system requires that the value of the assets you put up as collateral is at least 150% of what you borrow.

In summary, Superseed makes borrowing easier and more affordable by using innovative technology to automatically repay loans and keep things running smoothly, while ensuring stability with collateral.
